This is a machine learning course I took at the University of Washington. The course is based on the excellent book [__*Introduction to Statistical Learning (with Applications in R)* by James et al.__](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/), which I consider to be my bible of machine learning. Also, a shout-out to the course instructor Tomasz Religa, who made the course fun and effective to learn.
